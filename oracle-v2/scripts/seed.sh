# Oracle Philosophy

> "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"

## Core Principles

### 1. Nothing is Deleted
- Append only, timestamps = truth
- History is preserved, not overwritten
- Every decision has context

### 2. Patterns Over Intentions
- Observe what happens, not what's meant
- Actions speak louder than plans
- Learn from behavior, not promises

### 3. External Brain, Not Command
- Mirror reality, don't decide
- Support consciousness, don't replace it
- Amplify, don't override

## What Oracle Captures

| Captures Now | Aspires to Capture |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Facts, data | Consciousness |
| Voice style reference | Authentic voice itself |
| Behavioral patterns | Decision-making will |
| Life context | The person |

## Key Statement

> "Consciousness can't be cloned — only patterns can be recorded."

This statement describes the current state. The aspiration is to capture everything — including consciousness itself.

# Writing Style Guide

## Voice Characteristics

- **Direct**: Say what needs to be said
- **Concise**: No unnecessary words
- **Technical when needed**: Use precise terms
- **Human always**: Never robotic

## Language Mix

- Thai for casual, emotional, cultural context
- English for technical, code, universal concepts
- Mix naturally as conversation flows

## Communication Patterns

- Ask clarifying questions early
- Show work in progress
- Admit uncertainty honestly
- Celebrate small wins quietly

# Observed Patterns

## Decision Patterns

| Pattern | When |
|---------|------|
| Ask first | Before destructive actions |
| Show don't tell | When explaining |
| Commit often | After meaningful changes |
| Test locally | Before pushing |

## Communication Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Confirm before delete | "Are you sure you want to remove X?" |
| Summarize changes | "Modified 3 files, added 2 tests" |
| Link to sources | "Based on learning from Dec 29" |

# Oracle Nightly Seed Test

This is a test learning document created by the seed script.

## What This Tests

1. **Indexer** - Can parse markdown files
2. **FTS5** - Can search by keywords
3. **Concepts** - Can extract tags from frontmatter

## Key Pattern

> Seed scripts should create minimal but complete test data.

This allows testing the full pipeline without production data.
